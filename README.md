## Getting Started

This Project has been built with `thethirdweb` cli

run this project using this command:

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/main.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `src/index.jsx`, you'll find `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping the app,
this is necessary for the [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.
